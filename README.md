The goal of this project was to create a static restaurant website using React. The website has a landing page where users can navigate to the menu using React Router. The menu is interactive - displaying all choices and can be conditionally rendered based on the type of menu item.

As customer's add items to their order, their cart updates to show the item and the total price of their order. When an order is made, it saves to the browsers local storage.
